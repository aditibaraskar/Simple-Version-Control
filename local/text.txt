India is my country.
All Indians are my brothers and sisters.
I love my country.
And I am proud of it's rich and varied heritage.
I shall always strive to be worthy of it.
I shall give my parents teachers and elders respect.
And treat everyone with courtesy.
To my country and my people,
I pledge my devotion.
In their well being and prosperity alone lies my happiness.
You may please be seated.
